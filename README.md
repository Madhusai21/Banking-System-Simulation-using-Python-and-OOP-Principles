# Banking-System-Simulation-using-Python-and-OOP-Principles
# Here's a simple yet powerful banking application I built using Python, demonstrating the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 
# Abstraction – Clean methods like Customer_Details() hide implementation details and present only necessary info. 
# Encapsulation – Sensitive data like PIN and balance are protected with access checks. 
# Inheritance – LoanAccount class inherits from the Bank class, extending it with loan-specific functionality. 
#  Polymorphism – The Customer_Details() method is overridden in the child class to include loan information.  
#  Features:  Deposit & Withdrawal with PIN verification 
# Balance checking  Loan amount integration  User-friendly menu-driven interface
Whether you're learning or reviewing OOP, this is a great hands-on example to understand real-world applications.
